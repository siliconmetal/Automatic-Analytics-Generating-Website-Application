# Automatic-Analytics-Generating-Website-Application

While interning at Charmeuse Technologies, I designed, developed and tested a web-based analytics application that takes raw data in excel (xlsx) or comma-separated-values (CSV) and automatically reads the data file, and automatically generates analytics and predictions.

The focused users were the stakeholders of the textile industry. And the aim was to provide a user-friendly and easy-to-operate platform with no technological pre-requisites. The application directly asks the user to upload the data either by browsing the device or drag-and-drop the file.

The web application was developed using Python programming, using various logical implementations and libraries—for environment development, data analysis, and data visualization—including:
* Streamlit,
* Prophet(Neural Prophet),
* Pandas,
* Numpy,
* Sklearn,
* Matplotlib,
* Plotly,
* Seaborn,
* PIL,
* Datetime,
* Statsmodel,
* AutoTS,
* And operations like Data splitting, Regression, Dataframe operations, Groupby, Training & Testing, etc.

The application was developed using environments (IDEs/Text editors) like *Pycharm*, *Jupyter Notebook*, and *Anaconda Navigator*. Later for basic testing, the website application was hosted on the *Heroku* cloud platform.
