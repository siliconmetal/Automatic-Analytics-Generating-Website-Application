# Automatic-Analytics-Generating-Website-Application

While interning at Charmeuse Technologies, I developed and tested a web-based analytics application that takes raw data in excel (xlsx) or comma-separated-values (CSV) and automatically reads the data file, and generates analytics and predictions.

The focused users were the stakeholders of the textile industry. And the aim was to provide a very user-friendly and easy-to-operate platform with no technological pre-requisite. The application direct asks the user to upload the data either by browsing the device or directly drag-and-drop the file.

The web application was developed using Python programming, using various logical implementations and libraries—for environment development, data analysis, and data visualization—including:
Streamlit,
Prophet,
Pandas,
Numpy,
Sklearn,
Statsmodel,
AutoTS,
And operations like Data splitting, Regression, Dataframe operations, Groupby, Training & Testing, etc.

The application was developed using environments (IDEs/Text editors) like Pycharm, Jupyter Notebook, and Anaconda Navigator. Later for basic testing, the website application was hosted on the Heroku cloud platform.
