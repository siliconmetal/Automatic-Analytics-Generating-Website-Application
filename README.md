# Automatic-Analytics-Generating-Website-Application

While interning Charmeuse Technologies, I developed and tested an web based analyitcs application that takes raw data in excel (xlsx) or comma-seprated-values (csv) and automatically reads the data file and generates analystics and predictions.

The focused users were the stakeholders of textile industry. And the aim was to provide a very user-friendly and easy to operate platform with no technological pre-requisite. The application direct ask the user to upload the data either through browsing the device or directly drag-and-drop the file.

The web application was developed using Python programming, using various logical inplementations and libraties-for enviorment developent, data analysis, and data visualization-including:
* Streamlit,
* Prophet,
* Pandas,
* Numpy,
* Sklearn,
* Statsmodel,
* AutoTS,
* And operations like: Data spliting, Regression, Dataframe operations, Groupby, Trainng & Testing, etc.

The application was developed using enviroments (IDEs/Text editors) like Pycharm, Jupyter Notebook, and Anaconda Navigator. Later for basic testing the website application was hosted on heroku cloud platform.
