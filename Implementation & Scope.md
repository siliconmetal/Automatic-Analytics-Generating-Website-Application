Since I developed the application for a software-developing company, I am not supposed to share the code, so I will be explaing the implementation with few snippets and the scope of this application.

1. Implementaion

1.1 For the first go-trying multiple libraies and logics-started developing the application on Jupyter Notebook, I find Juputer Notebook quite handy as I allows to check the implementation of each sub-script or loigc individually and in sequencial manner, and tried multiple libraries and logic out of which Stremlit suited the most.
