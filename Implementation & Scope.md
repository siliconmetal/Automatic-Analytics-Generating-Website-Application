Since I developed the application for a software-developing company, I am not supposed to share the code, so I will be quickly explaing the implementation with few snippets and the scope of this application.

### 1. Implementaion

#### 1.1 First Step 
For the first go-trying multiple libraies and logics-started developing the application on Jupyter Notebook, I find Juputer Notebook quite handy as I allows to check the implementation of each sub-script or loigc individually and in sequencial manner, and tried multiple libraries and logic out of which Stremlit suited the most.

#### 1.2 Starting Web Application Development 
Started the back-end development of the application in Pycharm using the required libraries. Developing is quite a long process where each feature of the application is individually coded and adjoined with the overall logic overcoming soo many errors, leading to the final implementaion.

#### 1.3 The UI
Using Streamlit the user-interface was designed. Firstly, the user needed to upload the data file under total five catagories, as per their requirements, and then depending upon the data uploaded after backend analysis data will be visualized using tabular and chart representaions as per entity corelation.
